<h1>Predicting Customer Churn: Unlocking Insights for Retention at SyriaTel</h1>


<h2> Business Understanding</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Customer churn is a key problem for telecommunications firms since losing customers has a direct influence on revenues and growth. This project seeks to create a machine learning classifier that can predict if a client will churn (leave SyriaTel). By studying customer usage habits, plan subscriptions, and contacts with the organization, we identify significant churn contributors and give practical ideas for reducing it.</p> <br>
